# Car Rental System [Backend]
Car Rental System is a simple system designed to meet the needs of companies renting cars for days. The app allows users to browse cars available for hire and send requests for car availability on the indicated date, along with a cost calculation. Administrators can easily respond to inquiries and manage cars and users.

It has been designed using a layered architecture, enabling effective management of business logic, presentation and data access. 

This repository contains only the backend.
